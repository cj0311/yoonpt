# Chatbot Project

This repository contains the source code for a chatbot implemented using JavaScript and Python. The chatbot is designed to run on both Android and web platforms.

## Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **androidJs**: This directory contains the JavaScript code for running the chatbot on Android.
2. **app**: This directory contains the Python and JavaScript code for running the chatbot on the web.

Additionally, there is a `Dockerfile` for containerizing the application.
